    <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
    <p>Thanks for your email. Codem Composites sound like a really
      interesting company, and you certainly know how to pique a geek's
      interest with mention of Star Wars props and the like. I have to
      say, though, that I'm having a hard time seeing the synergy you
      mention and I wouldn't want to waste your time on a fruitless
      call.</p>
    <p>Although we obviously have common interest in the aerospace
      industry, I have to emphasize that we are purely a software
      company. If that doesn't put you off then I am happy to have a
      chat this week. I'm current free on Thursday and Friday afternoon
      between 2 and 4.</p>
    <p>Best wishes,</p>
    <p>Mark<br>
    </p>

                is treating you well. I came across your LinkedIn
                profile whilst looking for the right person at Bright
                Ascension for a quick chat, so wanted to drop you a line
                by way of introduction.</span></span></p>

          <p><span><span> I head up the team here at Codem Composites
                and we provide end-to-end solutions for all things
                carbon fibre. Recently we’ve worked on projects with
                Mercedes F1, manufactured Raytheon's military antennas
                and produced props for the latest Star Wars movie, just
                to name a few.</span></span></p>

          <p><span><span>The reason for my email is that I think there's
                a great synergy between Codem and Bright Ascension, so
                I'm hoping that you can spare me a few minutes to chat. </span></span></p>
