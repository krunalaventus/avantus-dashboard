Hi Damian,


I trust this Friday afternoon is treating you well. I came across your
LinkedIn profile whilst looking for the right person at N I Railways for a
quick chat, so wanted to drop you a line by way of introduction.


I head up the team here at Codem Composites and we provide end-to-end
solutions for all things carbon fibre. Recently we=E2=80=99ve worked on pro=
jects
with Mercedes F1, manufactured Raytheon's military antennas and produced
props for the latest Star Wars movie, just to name a few.


The reason for my email is that I think there's great synergy between Codem
and N I Railways, so I'm hoping that you can spare me a few minutes to
chat.


I'm available for a quick call on Monday or Tuesday afternoon. If that
doesn=E2=80=99t work, tell me what does, and I=E2=80=99ll make it happen.


Hope you have a great weekend.
